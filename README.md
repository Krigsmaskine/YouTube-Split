A track listing is automatically generated by the program. Track titles, artists, and album names can be edited next.
The cover art can also be changed. The user must then select an audio format and bitrate to save as, along with a target directory.

Finally, after hitting download, the program outputs each song to the target folder as separate files. 
Each of the filenames are fully formatted and each file comes with metadata info along with cover art.
